## 1. VANAKURAT [old devil]

### TUULISPASK ft. SAME ME

#### TUULISPASK

vanakurat is dirty  
vanakurat is old  
vanakurat is young  
and vanakurat is bad  
vanakurat is a bastard  
and vanakurat doesn’t give up  
vanakurat is a martyr  
and vanakurat is indifferent  
vanakurat doesn’t give a shit  
and vanakurat says to hell with it  
vanakurat in the olden days  
did hell of a vanakurat’s foul play  
vanakurat is a feminist  
and vanakurat is a terrorist  
vanakurat is hell of a dancer  
vanakurat is a vandalizer  
vanakurat is a guardian of freedom  
vanakurat is a mocker for the hell of it  
vanakurat is free  
and vanakurat has a tail  
vanakurat plays mouth harp  
and vanakurat cries after being too merry  
vanakurat can go to hell  
but vanakurat knows it too well  
vanakurat hates the cops  
and all foreign agent knots  
vanakurat wants ceasefire  
and vanakurat has a grumpy attire  
vanakurat is our mind  
and vanakurat is out of their mind  
vanakurat is a faggot  
and vanakurat looks like a maggot  
vanakurat sings lullabies  
vanakurat laughs until they cry  
vanakurat is a lost cause  
vanakurat does what a vanakurat does  
vanakurat is a mutt with hands  
but, foremost, vanakurat is trans

With Spells, we summon them.  
With Spells, we summon them.

#### SAME ME

I see them led astray.  
Welcomed by eldritch arms.  
Full of death, they pray.  
Picked health and sickness apart  
For their weight in gold and glass.

Preying on the weak.  
Flayed fingers holding casts.  
Into the fray for the wars they start.  
Mother on her knees, grieves with a bleeding heart.  
No one wins, we all come last.  
I hear them pave their way.  
Seldom felt with the past.  
Push them back, they pray.  
Ticking boxes, ticking clocks, bodies in a cart.

We did not ask for this to come to us.  
Listen to our words when they silence us.  
Deep down disdain for what they're fucking up.  
Glisten with unity holding this up.  
Yeah, we’re holding this up.  
We’re holding this up.  
We’re holding it up.  
We’re holding it up.

## 2. EFFIGIES

### SAME ME

#### SAME ME

Psychotic episodes  
Blood from the pen  
Stuck high no stability  
Lock, unlocked again  
Trapped lies from the telephone  
Epiphanies I misconstrued  
Scrapped rhymes to the metronome  
Similes left obtuse  
Slept right through to the crossroads  
Officially alone in the dark  
Now I'm fearful of metaphors  
Tearful and filled with dread  
Ever more  
The scale broadens  
Forever in my head, imagination's raw  
Lesser, moving forward in forfeit  
Swing withdrawals, sessions in depth  
List of improvements, but I didn't order it  
I picked into the precautions, I lost all endorphins, and repeated to death

Drenched in sweat, letters and lead  
Events misled, receptors oppressed  
Possessed by debtors, impressed to confess  
We stressed them with remedies  
They fed us to our enemies  
They're blessing us with effigies  
Tumultuous, obscene  
Feet firmly on the ground  
Presumptions flee  
Streets early, profound  
Deductions don't come free

## 3. HELD

### SAME ME & SLOTTA

#### SAME ME

Putrid pulsating pundits  
Lucid lullabies, serenaded by luddites  
Two toothpicks in the eye plucking me blind  
Lose loose change down the side of the sofa  
Food blues I cooked, ate just to lose it to the odour  
Gotta fill, gotta feel, something real  
Lot of bills, slots and dodgy deals  
Jars of bile, piled up on wonky shelves  
Depart quite far for a while  
Blown apart, bloated and swelled  
Groaned at the start of hell  
Pink laces, soft bells, hard-core and gentle  
Poems as weapons, death disassembled.  
Soldiers in war, sharing tears not blood shed  
Caring for one another, no fear, open and vulnerable hearts they bled

muddled head...  
cuddled in bed...  
ruffled feathers, buckshot in the red  
all of a sudden, scuttled away to death  
rustle in the bushes, scared from a single breath  
subtle as a push.  
mingle? deathwish.  
one foot in the puddle  
tingle? sepsis.  
stubborn as stubble  
to dwindle away, I know the exit…

We all just wanna be held  
Free to fall wherever we choose  
See a dear friend, those labels just melt  
Labels just melt… when you've got love?  
Everything's to lose, til there's nothing left

#### SLOTTA

my love i am afraid  
my hands are too blue to hold you  
every broken dish every shattered vase is in your eyes  
no in my eyes  
i look at you and every time something flashes  
dripping tap in an empty room who left it running  
when i’m already asleep you’re keeping watch  
when i’m already asleep you’re keeping watch  
geese are gone swans are gone the ground is cold  
you’ve seen so much and still — until we’ve had enough — it’s me you hold  
wearing snow of the swans i curl up in your lap the heart gets swathed in tulle  
hands after hands interweaving around my shoulders hips ankles  
i want to provide care as long there are benches and undersides of bridges which don’t let us sleep  
i want to reach my arms out around you around you all and around us before anyone can conquer can spoil the castles built out of our happiness before anyone directs shame and insecurity on the stage of the castle’s overgrown courtyard before we believe them

the skin was so thin and already you grow new bluegrass over it and endless moss over my lap i pull up the mossy sheets over our heads  
i pull up the sheets and you see how deeply blue my hands are  
do you see how deeply blue my hands are

We all just wanna be held  
Free to fall wherever we choose  
See a dear friend, those labels just melt  
Labels just melt… when you've got love?  
Everythings to lose, til there's nothing left

but nations of pain  
we arrived at the same station but took different trains

## 4. PLANTS & LIZARDS

### SAME ME, KYLM TEE

#### SAME ME

Dysphoria just fucks with me  
Dysmorphia distortion reflects  
Rigor mortis contortion, I’m a freak  
Slithered into my bed  
Hide forever rent free  
Withered away I'm pretty much dead  
Like Samuel  
Filtering the toxins ahead  
On my back like a pack mule  
The pin says she/they, it's on my chest  
Thank you.  
Seize the opportunity we need this community, they freeze up to my honesty  
Can't help it honestly, crying under scrutiny  
I hurt, on a timer  
The world turns in a grinder  
We're stuck in its teeth  
Prying my way out to you and me  
Trying to break out  
Still fucking here fighting, for the right thing

Inflicted savagery  
Conflicted insanity  
Ripped from incapacity  
Fuck neutrality, radically  
Rapidly descend into agony  
Burnout after burnout, I'm empty  
It's a tragedy  
Wait for everyone to leave me anxiously  
Pattern recognitions weaving tapestries  
Demons in my ears here, whispering fallacies  
When you're done facing mortality  
Under the microscope  
Cluster of isotopes  
Uttered my brightest notes  
Shuddered, with a tightened throat  
Bloody and frightened, I lied and hoped  
Trauma response, how do I cope  
Roll another joint, take a couple tokes.  
Flora renaissance, across the globe  
Plants in abundance, please let us grow

#### Külm Tee

All these distractions dehydrate,  
never casual, and too restless to read a manual,  
binaries provisional,  
Abolish the traditional,  
Practice your autonomy  
Organically ascend into anarchy

Time to learn how to have down days,  
I don't want our future to decay.  
Chaos and dismay aren't the same  
The change we create will outlast this world set ablaze  
Carry what you say  
This time what we build  
will see the sun rays  
When the noise overwhelms, I look at the sun  
Contra point to the somber  
Inherited manners  
I’ll put the soup on the stove, chemistry  
The core is blistering  
On the lap of (old)devil, peace runs past, I can’t wait any longer for the arrival of judas, achieving freedom is not a science  
Until then we’ll be looking for cellars and damp rooms where to be  
Where to be  
Break down the systems that don’t include us  
Leave them and come create with us,  
You’re a lizard, so roam free.

## 5. 7 DAYS SOBER

### TUULISPASK, KYLM TEE, SAME ME

#### Tuulispask

dear mom, i’m sorry to betray you  
but drugless days are too hard now for me to get through and  
dear mom, i am sorry to betray you  
but drugless days are too hard now for me to get through

for twenty years i didn’t drink, didn’t smoke up  
avoided drugs, i feared that if i start i couldn’t give it up  
it was easy to be straight edge, to be sober  
hiding behind drugs didn’t seem quite proper  
never took painkillers when my pain was profuse  
while my peers were juiced on vodka i was drinking juice  
in the evenings trauma, depression harrassing me  
in a crowd my gut filled up with anxiety  
but it was my duty — staying away from drugs  
quite a few were taken aback by these talks  
but as you know what goes up must come down  
and life is not a breeze when you are off your gourd  
in my thoughts climate crisis got stuck  
i understood that the world is surely fucked  
when i die young why preserve myself for old-age  
why should i resist when the end soon approaches

antidepressants, minttu made my mind and thoughts surrender  
antidepressants, minttu, i was on a bender  
for me company and shots were of some relief  
but after drinking i was feeling down for a week

(escitalopram i swallow it with ease  
no please i cannot drink don’t pour it out for me  
escitalopram i swallow it with ease  
my dear friend just pass the spliff for me please)  
cannabis became my new painkiller  
it so ably made my troubled mind stiller

soon enough it started looking like addiction  
the habit lured me in so i became accustomed  
a smoky reek was creeping up on me but then  
tolerance, i need to take a break again  
once again each night i’m getting hit with murk  
once again i think i’m nothing but a jerk  
all is loud again those thoughts and all those faces  
i get so anxious once again in public spaces

once again i had to deal with multitude of pains  
once again i found pain baggage gathered in my school days  
are these withdrawal symptoms i don’t know  
all in all it all was such a sudden blow  
two days in a row i took a puff  
on the third the thought of quitting for me seemed too tough

#### Külm Tee VERSE 2

On the third the thought of quitting for me seemed too tough  
Falling out of sync, because seven days have passed  
Without an inhale, without you, seven days out of myself  
Substances without me, the fumes from match smoke burst into my nostrils  
Grandmother called the landline, and said she knows how to cure depression  
Every morning, you have to looking into the mirror and smile at yourself, but grandmother  
You have no idea what I do under the blanket, the warmth escapes from the cloak, the hand doesn’t reach further, every attempt has failed, ash in the cookie crumbs, I breathe in the fumes from match smoke, i have a painful bruise on my roof, everyone is always where? Senses, senses are upside down, we summoned the old devil,  
a fist to the gut, a mess in the wardrobe,  
It’s difficult with a weapon that doesn’t fit around the waist belt  
Which is too clumsy between the cheeks, too tight to fit around my ankle, bitter between my palms, my knees under pressure.  
I am not in a brave state, I’m scared of children,  
I don’t have the desire to defend, my forest is bare  
Where am I supposed to get the strength to mown the lawn?  
Where am I supposed to get the strength to boil soup?  
When my neighbour is stealing my electricity and looking for ways to earn sugar?  
I help them along, and put buter in my pocket.  
Where am I supposed to get my strength, when seven days have already passed.  
Come on my lap with starch in your mouth, if I wanted you then the ground below our feet would collapse and we would embrace. Time stretches through the bones, you frown and eat, you abuse and beat ,every night crying in your armpit. The field sawed through the treebark, fertilized up to the ankles, in the soil, swelling shale oil, a bronze bullet stuck in the ovaries, i’ll swallow your rusted bed. My grandmother says, I know how to cure depression.

#### CHORUS

we're the same, but we try to change  
never sane, but we try to change

#### SAME ME VERSE 3

a pinch of salt  
every grain of sand evades  
this whole world halts  
just my shaky hands remain  
what it took to pause this internal war  
existence rarely waits  
rage turns to flaky pores  
falls like snow melted into rapid rains  
stored on my droopy face  
i stare above, dopamine, rare as love  
stars shine back at me, i don't care enough  
it's not the same with just air in my lungs  
intrusive thoughts tied my tongue  
keeping me awake  
nightmares race i'm braced for strife  
though each one is a keepsake  
dozing off, not safe in this dreamscape  
it's too late to beg, in my pit i lay  
this path i fought for, it's a prison i made  
til i loop back around, green eyes gawk  
plants blazed, bathed in anxiety  
as i sleep, suffer in sobriety  
when i get high, time flies by, medicinal fix for society,  
but i don't live for it  
every day only dysphoric, escape mine  
with pastimes, no P's to pay for this shit topic  
so why write? why rhyme?  
why make beats? i just can't lock in  
i’m searching with different eyes  
i only got better lows  
years of smoke, i've grown dependant  
the fears of my life, alone and independant  
my peers and i, grow and roam in transcendence

## 6. CHRONIC

### SAME ME

Intestines, vomit and lose it  
Projections top it off crudely  
Move pain, dig further down into my abdomen  
Move attention to the tension  
Can't sleep can't rest don't eat  
Distractions, inventions and interventions  
Skin rashes, interactions and music  
Nothing helps, yeah, I just do shit  
Bluffing, meds, therapeutic  
Self therapised, again, never futile  
On the floor like a futon  
Consumed with the fear death  
So poor but the soup's on  
Static in panic, manic, satanic  
Stomach spells  
Lacking, organics, it’s a frantic state of antics  
Flummoxed and fucking unwell  
What do I do? What do I do???  
My body's been annexed, by chronic pains  
Stop, locked, everything's screwed  
Soggy and vexed, no tonic for this pouring rain  
But I've got my crew, they’re here to help me when I feel sore and blue  
Life could be good, without these fucking hoops, that they're making us jump through.

#### kylm tee

My foot is hurting, drilling  
A kilo of metal-  
Scrap in my left ankle,  
I can’t sit at home  
The engine requires attention,  
Seven years ago I stepped over  
Mania, addiction, i sought  
Speed for racing,  
Self destruction, no to life  
But I don’t fit into a solid square,  
Everything is constantly changing,  
My soles covered in soot  
A wheelchair follows me, I don’t track my joints, tensed bones.  
BURNTOUT, BURNTOUT, BURNTOUT  
Dried up moss, the core is hollow  
The noise in my lungs as i cough - I tripped on a wire  
My foot is swollen, I believe I was delivered by a stalk.  
How is it possible to disarm weapons, to not descend further into the decay?  
I need more money to have self-care.

#### tagtag

I have stomach ache,  
I can no longer take,  
How much shit can fit in  
Til I can have harmony?  
x2

#### Tuulispask

Am I well ? or am I sick? Is everything in my head? Should I be under influence? Do I need a nurse, or should I abstain, should I screw around, or punish myself?  
Suspicions and illness, one idea grows in me  
Depression, anger, I’m not sure which is true.

Remind me how I’m not needed,  
The individual is insignificant, only money counts  
As a vegetable one belongs to the soil  
I can’t bear it, no strength, I’ll escape to the woods  
The bear understands, when I hibernate for half a year  
Moss understands, when I just mould  
With a fox I can bark and howl together  
The wolf knows how it’s like dying in others’ anger

#### konnad

joint pain, headaches, nausea  
and fucking neuropathy  
whatever, i'll live with it  
the thing i can't stand is fatigue  
laying in bed for hours, days  
weeks, months on end, break, repeat  
get up to not waste away  
no more than to do what i need  
hold hope for some improvement  
for years, this is how it's been  
learning about this body  
makes decline way likelier seem

but hope, it dies fucking last  
i'll just go take another bath

#### tohuwabohu

lying again in my bed  
i’m sleeping through the year  
in the dark room all is grey cat under my arm ice pack under my head  
through my bridge the blade invisible hews  
spreads itself across a year or two  
the dullness — an evenly spread light grey hue  
it’s a good day if ibuprofen works its way it’s a good day if acetaminophen kills the pain  
if i’m lucky my stomach still won’t give in to the cocktail of pills  
if i’m lucky health insurance will believe in my ill  
if i’ll ever be lucky this pain will end someday  
but i am lucky  
my dear partner does the dishes and takes out the trash  
they do my laundry and feed me and clean up and play the same simple card game again  
my thinking has shriveled but there will come a day when  
i get out of bed get out of the room  
light does not blind me  
and wind caresses my head  
that is no longer aching
